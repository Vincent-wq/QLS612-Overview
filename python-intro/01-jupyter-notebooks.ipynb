    "# The Jupyter notebook: a quick overview\n",
    "Many of the presentations at Neurohackademy (including this one!) use Jupyter notebooks. In this brief, self-referential notebook, we'll provide a very short overview of the notebook, which should allow you to start experimenting and interacting with code in no time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Jupyter notebook?\n",
    "It's hard to do better than the definition found on [Project Jupyter's]((http://jupyter.org)) website:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is directly descended from the IPython Notebook, so if you've heard (or even used!) the latter, the idea here may already be familiar to you. There are also many similarities to R Markdown documents and R Notebooks, if you've used those.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Language support\n",
    "Historically, people have tended to identify Jupyter notebooks with the Python programming language. It's safe to say that Python is still by far the most common language used in Jupyter notebooks, but it's important to note that, these days, this is a matter of choice rather necessity. Jupyter kernels are available for [many different languages](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels), including \n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook structure: cells\n",
    "We can think of a Jupyter notebook as essentially a living document wrapped around a command prompt. Instead of either (a) typing lines one by one into an interactive prompt (as we might do in, e.g., a linux shell, or the RStudio prompt), or (b) putting all of our code in a single file that runs linearly when executed, notebooks are structured into discrete **cells**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell types\n",
    "Cells are the building blocks of a notebook; they can be created, deleted, moved around, and executed. And they come in different flavors. There are several different types of cells in Jupyter notebook, but the two primary ones are *markdown cells* and *code cells*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown cells\n",
    "Markdown cells contain [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which is a lightweight markup language that allows us to style plain text by rendering it with headings, lists, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell you're reading right now is a Markdown cell. If you're reading this as a rendered notebook on the web, it'll just look like any other webpage, and you won't be able to interact with the cell contents. But if you're running this notebook on a local Jupyter notebook server, or in a Jupyter lab environment, you can edit the cell directly. All you have to do is double click on the cell, or click to highlight it and the press the Enter/Return key. Then you can edit the Markdown as you please, and once you run the cell (more on that in a moment), your changes will be rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code cells\n",
    "Code cells contain—surprise!—code. The language the code is written can vary depending on what kernel you're running, and with a bit of work (which we won't cover here), you can even use multiple languages in the same notebook, with the language potentially varying on a cell-by-cell basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what a Python code cell looks like:"

    "##### In-line rendering\n",
    "When code cells contain code that generates images, Jupyter allows you to render those images in-line (provided the language kernel you're using supports it). For example, here's some Python code that generates a histogram. Note the special `%matplotlib inline` command at the top; this is an instruction to Jupyter indicating that plots should be rendered inline (i.e., just below the cell), rather than handing the generated plot off to the operating system."

    "When we're in edit mode, we're interacting with, or editing, the contents of an individual cell. We can tell we're in edit mode if the cell border is green. To enter edit mode, we either click on some text or code in a cell that's already in edit mode, or highlight a cell that isn't in edit mode (e.g., a markdown cell that's been rendered) and press Enter. To exit edit mode, press the Esc key, click outside of any cell (e.g., on the edges of the notebook), or run the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command mode\n",
    "In command mode, we can perform operations on one or more cells, but we can't alter the contents of any individual cell. We use command mode to create or delete cells; move them around; cut, copy, and paste them; execute them; and so on. To enter command mode, press the Esc key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigating notebooks\n",
    "Notebooks are fairly simple to use, and it doesn't take long to get the hang of it. The best way to understand how mouse navigation works is to just click around on various things and see what happens. Many of the commands in the menus are also fairly self-explanatory. The toolbar contains icons for some of the most common operations—e.g., saving the current notebook, creating a new notebook, moving cells up or down, and so on. You can hover over any of the icons for a few seconds to bring up tooltips that tell you what the button does.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Keyboard navigation\n",
    "Once you get comfortable in the Jupyter environment, you'll probably find yourself relying heavily on keyboard shortcuts. Jupyter provides a lot of shortcuts out of the box, and can be further customized via third-party plugins. The main thing to be aware of is that the effects of different keys depend on what mode you're in: edit or command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to learn the shortcuts is to consult the help. You can either select \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" from the help, or, if you're in command mode, press the \"h\" key to bring up the same display.\n",

The extension also provides command-line hooks that make it easier to customize specific aspects (e.g., increasing font size in cell mode)."

    "Jupyter Notebook is an environment for writing and editing interactive notebooks. But its emphasis is very heavily on crafting individual notebooks. There's very ittle support for other important tasks users regularly engage in—e.g., managing multiple notebooks; organizing files; inspecting the contents of variables; and so on. Put simply, outside of the actual document construction process, Jupyter Notebook leaves much to be desired.\n",

    "Fortunately, the Jupyter Project recently launched [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which provides a much more full-featured user interface. Eventually, JupyterLab will completely replace Jupyter Notebook. For the moment, you can still use the latter in a standalone manner, but there's not really much reason to, seeing as you get all of the benefits of Jupyter Notebook in JupyterLab, plus many more."

    "## When to use Jupyter and when not to use Jupyter\n",
    "The ability to seamlessly combine text, code, and figures in one document—potentially creating completely reproducible, shareable workflows—has led to widespread adoption of Jupyter notebooks (and other similar technologies) in recent years. Some particular common use cases:\n",
    "* Presentation of information in a form that allows readers to easily interact and experiment with contents. Notebooks are exceptional teaching tools, as students can directly interact with code and immediately observe the results.\n",
    "* Consolidated presentation of research results/reports, where code and figures can be presented in-line—essentially providing a better version of the scientific research paper.\n",
    "* Rapid prototyping of plotting-intensive analysis workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, Jupyter notebooks aren't the right tool for everything. Their massive popularity has spawned something of a backlash in recent years (see, e.g., [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n2RlMdmv1p25Xy5thJUhkKGvjtV-dkAIsUXP-AL4ffI/edit?usp=sharing) or this [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-reasons-why-jupyter-notebooks-suck-4dc201e27086)). Many of these criticisms are accurate, though they're probably better understood as criticisms of how people sometimes *use* notebooks, than about intrinsic limitations of the technology itself. In particular, it's important to note that notebooks are no substitute for a good integrated development environment (IDE), and overreliance on them can promote poor development practices and introduce serious version control difficulties. In general, we don't recommend using notebooks for serious software development. But for the use cases described above, they can be invaluable."
